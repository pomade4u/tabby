## The goal of this list is to document and block websites known to utilize fingerprinting.

## Fingerprinting is one of the most invasive forms of tracking out there; it's an unacceptable practice that I've unfortunately seen become more and more normalized. As such, I personally view it on the same level as malware; and believe it should be treated accordingly.

## This will NOT block actual fingerprinters themselves; those are blocked on all other lists where relevant.
## This list will ensure that users are made aware of websites known to utilize fingerprinting, and decide for themselves whether they want to visit the site due to that risk.

## If your website is listed here and you'd like it to be removed, I will do so IF and ONLY IF you remove ALL fingerprinting from your website. Please file an issue or email me (celenity@celenity.dev) with evidence if you decide to do so.
