! Description: Block the Page Visibility API to allow background audio/video playback (and limit tracking).
! Homepage: https://badblock.celenity.dev

! Page Visibility is an API used for determining whether a page is active/in focus.
! It's commonly used to prevent background audio/video playback, and is used for tracking.

! Blocking this API improves the privacy and browsing experience for users.

*##+js(aeld, blur)
*##+js(aeld, focus)
*##+js(aeld, lostpointercapture)
*##+js(aeld, mouseleave)
*##+js(aeld, mouseout)
*##+js(aeld, pagehide)
*##+js(aeld, visibilitychange)

! I would also like to add these:
!*##+js(set, document.hasFocus, trueFunc)
!*##+js(set, document.hidden, false)
! But I won't until this is resolved: https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBlock-issues/issues/3672, as we also need to be able to set document.visibilityState to 'visible' (which is currently not possible without 'trusted' filters); not doing so could aid fingerprinting and cause issues.
